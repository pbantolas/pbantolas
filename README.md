# Hi there, I'm Petros üëã

I'm an iOS developer with a love for coffee, clean code, and building tools I actually want to use. After an amazing 8+ year journey in the corporate world, including three years at Apple, I'm now independent and building my own app ideas.

### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

* üî≠ I‚Äôm currently building **[LatteArtist](https://latteartist.coffeeatpetros.com)**, an iOS app to help you master latte art, practice patterns, and track your progress.
* üå± I‚Äôm slowly teaching myself the finer points of product & design.
* üíº My background is in graphics! At Apple, I worked on HDR technologies and supported game developers using the Metal API.
